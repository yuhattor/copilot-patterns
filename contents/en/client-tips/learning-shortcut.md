## Learning Shortcuts in VSCode with Copilot

### Description

Visual Studio Code provides developers with a set of keyboard shortcuts to accelerate the coding process. These shortcuts make the navigation and interaction with GitHub Copilot's AI-driven suggestions more intuitive and efficient. In this pattern, we will explore the keyboard shortcuts that are essential for rapid code development with Copilot.

#### Samples

For example, to accept a suggestion from Copilot, you can simply press the `TAB` key. Here's a list of some key shortcuts:

```markdown
- Accept suggestion: TAB key
- Reject suggestion: Esc key
- Show combined suggestions: Ctrl+Enter key
- Accept at word level: Ctrl + Right Arrow key
- See next suggestion: Alt + ]
- See previous suggestion: Alt + [
- Trigger inline suggestion: Alt + /
- Show Labs feature list: Ctrl+Shift+Alt+e
- Toggle sidebar: Ctrl+Shift+a
```

### Exercise

- **Exercise 1**: Try using the `TAB` key to accept a Copilot suggestion in your current project. How does it feel?
- **Exercise 2**: Press `Esc` key to reject a suggestion. What happens?
- **Exercise 3**: Use `Ctrl+Enter` key to see combined suggestions. Explore them and identify a useful one.
- **Exercise 4**: Navigate through the suggestions using `Alt + ]` and `Alt + [` keys. How does it affect your code selection process?
- **Exercise 5**: Experiment with the other shortcuts listed above and describe your experience with each of them.

### Checklist for Further Learning

- Have I internalized the shortcuts for accepting and rejecting Copilot suggestions?
- Am I comfortable using shortcuts to navigate through multiple suggestions?
- What other shortcuts within VSCode can enhance my coding experience with Copilot?
- How can I customize the shortcuts to suit my personal coding workflow?
- Could the use of these shortcuts help me in other coding environments or only in Visual Studio Code with Copilot?
